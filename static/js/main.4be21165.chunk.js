However, recently the platform used to host homework and exams for the course (PrairieLearn) has integrated support for Jupyter Hub and the students now use that platform exclusively for their labs and as the IDE they are given for exams and quizzes. As such, I\u2019ve largely abandoned repl.it is for lectures in favor of Jupyter. The reasons for this are twofold: 1) I imagine it\u2019s distracting for students to have to watch me switch tabs and 2) I don\u2019t like switching tabs. It\u2019s much easier for me to have the simple scripting process in an environment the students are already familiar with and have all visualizations present in that same environment.

This guide seeks to fill this gap by providing beginners to the distro with a visual installation guide that follows the same structure as the installation guide present on archlinux.org.

This study seeks to fill this gap by modeling student engagement with a Jupyter-notebook-based interactive textbook. Our findings suggest that students' active interactions with the presented interactive textbook, including changing, adding, and executing code in addition to manipulating visualizations, are significantly stronger in predicting student performance than conventional reading metrics.

Objective: to investigate the impacts of different designs of automated feedback on student learning at a fine-grained level, and how students interacted with and perceived the feedback. Method: a controlled quasi-experiment of 76 CS students, where students of each group received a different combination of three types of automated feedback for their programming assignments. Findings: feedback addressing the gap between expected and actual outputs is critical to effective learning; feedback lacking enough details may lead to system gaming behaviors.

In contrast, the aptitude test results indicated that the effects of student prior knowledge did not weaken over time. The accuracy of both measurements and implications for instructors were further discussed."},{title:"A Systematic Investigation of Replications in Computing Education Research",image_path:"assets/meta.png",link:"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3345328",abstract:"As the societal demands for application and knowledge in computer science increase, computer science student enrollment keeps growing rapidly around the world. By continuously improving the efficacy of computing education and providing guidelines for learning and teaching practice, computing education research plays a vital role in addressing both educational and societal challenges that emerge from the growth of computer science students. Given the significant role of computing education research, it is important to ensure the reliability of studies in this field. The extent to which studies can be replicated in a field is one of the most important standards for reliability. Different fields have paid an increasing attention to the replication rates of their studies, but the replication rate of computing education was never systematically studied. To fill this gap, this study investigated the replication rate of computing education between 2009 and 2018. We examined 2,269 published studies from three major conferences and two major journals in computing education, and found that the overall replication rate of computing education was 2.38%. This study demonstrated the needs for more replication studies in computing education and discussed how to encourage replication studies through research initiatives and policy making."},{title:"Investigating the Essential of Meaningful Automated Formative Feedback for Programming Assignments",image_path:"assets/feedback.png",link:"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08937",abstract:"This study investigated the essential of meaningful automated feedback for programming assignments. Three different types of feedback were tested, including (a) What's wrong - what test cases were testing and which failed, (b) Gap - comparisons between expected and actual outputs, and (c) Hint - hints on how to fix problems if test cases failed. 46 students taking a CS2 participated in this study. They were divided into three groups, and the feedback configurations for each group were different: (1) Group One - What's wrong, (2) Group Two - What's wrong + Gap, (3) Group Three - What's wrong + Gap + Hint. This study found that simply knowing what failed did not help students sufficiently, and might stimulate system gaming behavior. Hints were not found to be impactful on student performance or their usage of automated feedback. Based on the findings, this study provides practical guidance on the design of automated feedback."}]}]},64:function(e,t,a){e.exports=a(176)},70:function(e,t,a){},72:function(e,t,a){},74:function(e,t,a){},85:function(e,t,a){},87:function(e,t,a){},89:function(e,t,a){}},[[64,2,1]]]);
