We used to use repl.it for simple scripting tutorials, Python Tutor for in-depth code tracing discussions, and occasionally Jupyter when going over file reading and HTML. However, recently the platform used to host homework and exams for the course (PrairieLearn) has integrated support for Jupyter Hub and the students now use that platform exclusively for their labs and as the IDE they are given for exams and quizzes. As such, I\u2019ve largely abandoned repl.it is for lectures in favor of Jupyter. The reasons for this are twofold: 1) I imagine it\u2019s distracting for students to have to watch me switch tabs and 2) I don\u2019t like switching tabs. It\u2019s much easier for me to have the simple scripting process in an environment the students are already familiar with and have all visualizations present in that same environment.

Though this is effective in getting users from point A to point B, it does little to help them when things inevitably go off course. Though the Arch Linux wiki is a prolific source of wisdom, it is also potentially overwhelming to a user who barely knows where to begin in the first place. Furthermore, the archlinux.org\u2019s installation guide is adequate but lacks visual guides and omits many details necessary for a user to understand the whys and wherefores of their actions. This guide seeks to fill this gap by providing beginners to the distro with a visual installation guide that follows the same structure as the installation guide present on archlinux.org. This is done with the intention of being supplementary to the official wiki such that, in the event a user becomes stuck, they may smoothly transition between the two guides while attempting to solve their\xa0issue."}]},60:function(e){e.exports=[{year:"2023",publications:[{title:"Investigating the Effects of Testing Frequency on Programming Performance and Students' Behavior",image_path:"assets/textbook.png",link:"",abstract:"We conducted an across-semester quasi-experimental study that compared students\u2019 outcomes under frequent and infrequent testing regimens in an introductory computer science course. Students in the frequent testing (4 quizzes and 4 exams) semester outperformed the infrequent testing (1 midterm and 1 final exam) semester by 9.1 to 13.5 percentage points on code writing questions. We complement these performance results with additional data from surveys, interviews, and analysis of textbook behavior. In the surveys, students report a preference for the smaller number of exams, but rated the exams in the frequent testing semester to be both less difficult and less stressful, in spite of the exams containing identical content. In the interviews, students predominantly indicated (1) that the frequent testing regimen encourages better study habits (e.g., more attention to work, less cramming) and leads to better learning, (2) that frequent testing reduces test anxiety, and (3) that the frequent testing regimen was more fair, but these opinions were not universally held. The students\u2019 impressions that the frequent testing regimen would lead to better study habits is borne out in our analysis of students\u2019 activities in the course\u2019s interactive textbook. In the frequent testing semester, students spent more time on textbook readings and appeared to answer textbook questions more earnestly (i.e., less \u201cgaming the system\u201d by using hints and brute force)."},{title:"Discovering, Autogenerating, and Evaluating Distractors for Python Parsons Problems in CS1",image_path:"assets/textbook.png",link:"",abstract:"In this paper, we make three contributions related to the selection and use of distractors (lines of code reflecting common errors or misconceptions) in Parsons problems. First, we demonstrate a process by which templates for creating distractors can be selected through the analysis of student submissions to short answer questions. Second, we describe the creation of a tool that uses these templates to automatically generate distractors for novel problems. Third, we perform a preliminary analysis of how the presence of distractors impacts performance, problem solving efficiency, and item discrimination when used in summative assessments. Our results suggest that distractors should not be used in summative assessments because they significantly increase the problem's completion time without a significant increase in problem discrimination."},{title:"",image_path:"assets/feedback2.png",link:"",abstract:""}]},{year:"2022",publications:[{title:"Reevaluating the relationship between explaining, tracing, and writing skills in CS1 in a replication study",image_path:"assets/textbook.png",link:"",abstract:""},{title:"Are We Fair?

Prior research on digital textbooks and interactive visualizations contribute to our understanding of student interactions with visualizations and modeling textbook knowledge concepts.

This study seeks to fill this gap by modeling student engagement with a Jupyter-notebook-based interactive textbook. Our findings suggest that students' active interactions with the presented interactive textbook, including changing, adding, and executing code in addition to manipulating visualizations, are significantly stronger in predicting student performance than conventional reading metrics. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of student interactions with interactive textbooks and provide guidance on the effective usage of said textbooks in computing education."},{title:"Towards understanding the effective design of automated formative feedback for programming assignments",image_path:"assets/feedback2.png",link:"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08993408.2020.1860408?journalCode=ncse20",abstract:"Background and Context: automated feedback for programming assignments has great potential in promoting just-in-time learning, but there has been little work investigating the design of feedback in this context. Objective: to investigate the impacts of different designs of automated feedback on student learning at a fine-grained level, and how students interacted with and perceived the feedback. Method: a controlled quasi-experiment of 76 CS students, where students of each group received a different combination of three types of automated feedback for their programming assignments. Findings: feedback addressing the gap between expected and actual outputs is critical to effective learning; feedback lacking enough details may lead to system gaming behaviors. Implications: the design of feedback has substantial impacts on the efficacy of automated feedback for programming assignments; more research is needed to extend what is known about effective feedback design in this context."}]},{year:"2020",publications:[{title:"Towards Understanding Online Question & Answer Interactions and Their Effects on Student Performance in Large-Scale STEM Classes",image_path:"assets/qa-cloud.png",link:"https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-020-00200-7",abstract:"Online question & answer (Q & A) is a distinctive type of online interaction that is impactful on student learning. Prior studies on online interaction in large-scale classes mainly focused on online discussion and were conducted mainly in non-STEM fields. This research aims to quantify the effects of online Q & A interactions on student performance in the context of STEM education. 218 computer science students from a large university in the southeastern United States participated in this research. Data of four online Q & A activities was mined from the online Q & A forum for the course, including three student activities (asking questions, answering questions and viewing questions/answers) and one instructor activity (answering questions/providing clarifications). These activities were found to have different effects on student performance. Viewing questions/answers was found to have the greatest effect, while interaction with instructors showed minimum effects. This research fills the gap of lacking research in online Q & A, and the results of this research can inform the effective usage of online Q & A in large-scale STEM courses."}]},{year:"2019",publications:[{title:"Quantifying the Effects of Prior Knowledge in Entry-Level Programming Courses",image_path:"assets/comped.png",link:"https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3309503&preflayout=tabs",abstract:"Computer literacy and programming are being taught increasingly at the K-12 level with more students than ever matriculating in college with prior programming experience. Accurately assessing student programming skills acquired in high school can inform college faculty about the range of competencies in introductory programming courses. The tool predominantly-used for assessing past CS knowledge and skills is a survey, which lacks quantitative rigor. This study aims to (1) quantify the effects of prior knowledge in entry-level programming courses and (2) compare the different measurement approaches of student prior knowledge in programming, including surveys and aptitude tests. The results of this study reveal that a discrepancy exists between the results of surveys and aptitude tests. Consistent with prior survey studies, our survey results showed that the effects of student prior programming knowledge faded gradually during the course period. In contrast, the aptitude test results indicated that the effects of student prior knowledge did not weaken over time. The accuracy of both measurements and implications for instructors were further discussed."},{title:"A Systematic Investigation of Replications in Computing Education Research",image_path:"assets/meta.png",link:"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3345328",abstract:"As the societal demands for application and knowledge in computer science increase, computer science student enrollment keeps growing rapidly around the world. By continuously improving the efficacy of computing education and providing guidelines for learning and teaching practice, computing education research plays a vital role in addressing both educational and societal challenges that emerge from the growth of computer science students. Given the significant role of computing education research, it is important to ensure the reliability of studies in this field. The extent to which studies can be replicated in a field is one of the most important standards for reliability. Different fields have paid an increasing attention to the replication rates of their studies, but the replication rate of computing education was never systematically studied. To fill this gap, this study investigated the replication rate of computing education between 2009 and 2018. We examined 2,269 published studies from three major conferences and two major journals in computing education, and found that the overall replication rate of computing education was 2.38%. This study demonstrated the needs for more replication studies in computing education and discussed how to encourage replication studies through research initiatives and policy making."},{title:"Investigating the Essential of Meaningful Automated Formative Feedback for Programming Assignments",image_path:"assets/feedback.png",link:"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08937",abstract:"This study investigated the essential of meaningful automated feedback for programming assignments. Three different types of feedback were tested, including (a) What's wrong - what test cases were testing and which failed, (b) Gap - comparisons between expected and actual outputs, and (c) Hint - hints on how to fix problems if test cases failed. 46 students taking a CS2 participated in this study. They were divided into three groups, and the feedback configurations for each group were different: (1) Group One - What's wrong, (2) Group Two - What's wrong + Gap, (3) Group Three - What's wrong + Gap + Hint. This study found that simply knowing what failed did not help students sufficiently, and might stimulate system gaming behavior. Hints were not found to be impactful on student performance or their usage of automated feedback.
