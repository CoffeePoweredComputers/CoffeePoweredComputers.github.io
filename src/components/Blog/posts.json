  "body": "Over the last two years of doing Zoom lectures for hundreds of introductory Python students, one of the things I\u2019m always looking to do is reduce platforms. We used to use repl.it for simple scripting tutorials, Python Tutor for in-depth code tracing discussions, and occasionally Jupyter when going over file reading and HTML. However, recently the platform used to host homework and exams for the course (PrairieLearn) has integrated support for Jupyter Hub and the students now use that platform exclusively for their labs and as the IDE they are given for exams and quizzes. As such, I\u2019ve largely abandoned repl.it is for lectures in favor of Jupyter. The reasons for this are twofold: 1) I imagine it\u2019s distracting for students to have to watch me switch tabs and 2) I don\u2019t like switching tabs. It\u2019s much easier for me to have the simple scripting process in an environment the students are already familiar with and have all visualizations present in that same environment. As such, I came up with this little function to take the source from a cell that just ran in Jupyter and get an iFrame which can be embedded and run in a Jupyter notebook\u00a0itself."

  "body": "The IBM Model M. The greatest keyboard in the history of computing. This version, the M122, is the larger cousin of the iconic M with 122 keys of buckling spring goodness. I bought the keyboard pictured above a few years back with the intention of using the 22 function keys as a macro garden for my VIM and i3 workflow but never got around to it. Now, with an upcoming move for grad school and the prospect of rebuilding my workstation, I thought I\u2019d give the M122 a much needed refurbishing in anticipation of its future\u00a0use."

  "body": "When I first began venturing away from Ubuntu I was struck by the steepness of the learning curve present when attempting to install Arch for the first time. This was only worsened by the lack of \u201cbeginner-friendly\u201d material available. Most guides provided a purely procedural installation without explaining any of the intricacies of the actions being undertaken. Though this is effective in getting users from point A to point B, it does little to help them when things inevitably go off course. Though the Arch Linux wiki is a prolific source of wisdom, it is also potentially overwhelming to a user who barely knows where to begin in the first place. Furthermore, the archlinux.org\u2019s installation guide is adequate but lacks visual guides and omits many details necessary for a user to understand the whys and wherefores of their actions. This guide seeks to fill this gap by providing beginners to the distro with a visual installation guide that follows the same structure as the installation guide present on archlinux.org. This is done with the intention of being supplementary to the official wiki such that, in the event a user becomes stuck, they may smoothly transition between the two guides while attempting to solve their\u00a0issue."
