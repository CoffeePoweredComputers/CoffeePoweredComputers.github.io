                <strong>I develop interactive and engaging tools that support novice
                programmers.</strong> My goal as a researcher working at the
                intersection of Computing Education Research (CER) and
                Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is to draw on theories of
                learning to create effective and scalable approaches for

                A significant part of my work in this space has involved Parsons
                problems, a programming activity in which learners must correctly
                arrange code fragments to solve a problem. My most recent work aims
                to support novices in engaging with human-GenAI collaborative
                programming. The long-term vision for this research is to create
                tools and approaches that enable individuals from non-computing
                backgrounds to seamlessly integrate computing into their workflows
                through code generation by prompting â€” what could be characterized
                as natural language programming. My published and current work on
                these topics are detailed further in the following sections.

                      A key challenge in computer science education is developing pedagogical
                      approaches that are both engaging to students and aid in the efficient
                      acquisition of programming skills. A promising approach that has been the focus
                      of my research is Parsons problems, an activity where students
                      arrange blocks of code to form a program that satisfies a given
                      specification. This problem type has shown benefits both in formative contexts,
                      where they improve learning efficiency while reducing cognitive load, and
                      summative assessments, where they have been shown to test skills similar to code
                      writing.

                              The focus of my work in this area has been on the use of
                              distractors in Parsons problems. Distractors are incorrect
                              blocks of code that are included in the set of possible blocks
                              presented to the student when solving a Parsons problem. I
                              developed a novel approach to create and
                              then automatically generate distractors for Parsons problems.
                              My work has evaluated the effectiveness of these distractors in
                              both summative and formative contexts, finding that, though
                              they are somewhat ineffective at improving the quality of exam

                          approach, the individual's response to an EiPE question is used to

                        This project investigates pedagogical approaches for developing students' skills in 
                        human-GenAI collaborative programming. We are developing and evaluating activities 
                        that help students learn effective prompting strategies, including the ability to 
                        communicate intent clearly, analyze generated code critically, and iteratively refine prompts.

                        This project compares different methods for assessing code comprehension, including 
                        explain-in-plain-language questions, function naming tasks, and code tracing. We are 
                        investigating the relationships between these different assessment approaches and 
                        their correlation with code writing performance.
